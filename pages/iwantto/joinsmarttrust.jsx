        Smart Trust is a different kind of bank, built around a big idea - It’s
        your bank, because you own it. Every one of our members is an owner with
        a voice and a say in our future. We make responsible, ethical decisions
        that benefit our members and the community, and reinvest our profits to
        provide better products and services for our members.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve been in operation since 1959 and have built a team that values
        service, teamwork and integrity, to go above and beyond for our members.
        We’re a bank for you, the people you work with, and the people you know.
        A more rewarding community bank for everybody.
